# Financial Times Test

This project is a mini recreation of the Financial Times website, that allows users to search FT headlines.

The project layout is similar to FT homepage (up to the 5th row of articles - including the hero section) The usage is also similar with the user being able to search headlines by clicking the search icon and an input field dropping down for users to type search terms for the FT api. 

Search results display 12 articles per page with pagination at the bottom allowing users to easily see how many pages there are and the ability to click through them.

## Optional Requirements

Four of the optional requirements have been put in place

- Be responsive 
- Have pagination
- Deployed to heroku

- Get lower res images to optimise loading time.
- Hamburger menu to work as official site
- Add market stats at top of page- if further api access is permitted.
